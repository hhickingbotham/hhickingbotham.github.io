# Project Philosophy 
With any project, my goal will always be delivering high quality, professional work. I pride myself in my ability to create projects that communicate complex statistical analyses in a clear and consise way such that even non-statisticians can read them! 

## Multilinear Models Final Project 
For the final project of my multilinear models class, we were asked to look at two datasets: one about 150 Canadian and Alaskan salmon, and one with phenotype information for 110 patients. The methods applied to these datasets were: logistic regression, deviance analysis through a partial likelihood, classification trees, random forests, Fisherâ€™s Linear Discriminant Analysis, PCA and SPCA and clustering.

## Mathematical Statistics Project 1 and 2 
For my mathematical statistics projects, we were asked to analyze weather data of our choosing and come up with questions we could ask that the data would be able to answer. 

### Project 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis 
I took 50 years of weather data (high temp, low temp, precipitation) at San Francisco International Airport and asked: 
* When is the hottest time of the year, and does it often rain during that time?
* When is the coldest time of year, and does it often rain during that time?
* What are the precipitation levels throughout the year?
* What conclusions can be made by looking at the temperature and precipitation data?
The entire analysis was preformed in R.

### Project 2 - Expansion of Project 1 
In the first project, I did an analysis of 50 years of temperature and precipitation data from San Francisco International Airport. For this second project, I want to expand on my findings, and answer some additional questions:
* Are temperature and precipitation normal?
* What is the correlation between temperature and precipitation?
* What are the different correlation tests that can be performed?
* Which is the best to use in this particular instance?
